2007-Jul-20:   Version 0.2.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- NEW FEATURE: LOTW Import and Export. See 'MANUAL' for details. LOTW QSLs are
  considered for award purposes, with both a summary of paper-only and
  LOTW-only confirmations and a combined score.

- NEW FEATURE: At startup, automatically check for the existance of the
  neccessary database. If they do not exist, create them. If they are from a
  previous version of YFKlog, update them to the latest. This makes the
  installation a lot easier and more comfortable.

- IMPROVEMENT: Functions to determine DXCC from a callsign mostly rewritten and
  significantly faster (x 20) now.

- IMPROVEMENT: New field added for label printing: QSLR. Says 'TNX' if QSL was
  received, 'PSE' when QSL for this QSO is missing.

- IMPROVEMENT: Added 'hamlibparam' to the config file for additional
  hamlib/rigctl parameters

- IMPROVEMENT: When working a station, show if the DXCC is worked/confirmed
  already on all bands defined by 'awardbands' in the config file.
  Output like: "10C 12W 15C 17W 20C 30W 40C 80W"

- IMPROVEMENT: When working a station, it's now also possible to check for this
  callsign in any other logbooks, as set by the 'checklogs' variable in the
  config file.

- IMPROVEMENT: Possibility to specify a date range for ADIF-export.

- BUG FIX: QSL printing doesn't start at label -1 anymore...

- BUG FIX: Problems with / in $mycall resolved for label printing.


2007-Apr-28:   Version 0.2.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- NEW FEATURE: Hamlib support. See 'MANUAL' for details.

- IMPROVEMENT: Changed REGEX for callsign recognition, now calls like RV0AL/0/P
  are not causing problems anymore.

- IMPROVEMENT: Cleaned up SQL syntax. No more problems with MySQL5.

- IMPROVEMENT: ADIF-Import works with files that have DOS-linebreaks now, also
  uppercase file extensions (ADI) are now recognized.

- IMPROVEMENT: 47 GHz and up are now given in millimeters (instead of 0.x cm)
  on the QSL labels

- IMPROVEMENT: Added a new 'QSO / Mode' statistics function.

- IMPROVEMENT: Another QSL label definition for 70x36 (dm7a.lab) as used for
  thousands of contest cards at DM7A...

- BUGFIX: For some awards/statistics, the date range was ignored. Fixed.

- BUGFIX: When creating a new log, and the callsign contained a '/', the
  $mycall variable was faulty and caused YFKlog to crash. Fixed.

- BUGFIX: HTML-Output for DXCC, WPX awards etc had a minor bug for 2m only.


2006-Apr-16:   Version 0.2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- NEW FEATURE:	Band data now also allows the higher UHF bands like 70cm etc
  (enter as 0.7, 0.23...). This required a change in the database structure.
	************************************************************************
	*** IMPORTANT: READ AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS FROM FILE 'RELEASENOTES' ***
	************************************************************************
- NEW FEATURE:  Different screen layouts available for the main screen. See
                variable "screenlayout" in .yfklog.

- ADIF-Import: Field 'gridsquare' added to remarks field, if it exists. (tnx
               ES6CO)

- BUGFIX:  ADIF-Import: Fields containing a ' produced errors. Fixed.
- BUGFIX:  Callsigns like DJ1YFK/123 were not properly recognized.
- BUGFIX:  Invalid callsigns (like QQ0XX) don't produce ugly warning messages
           anymore.
- BUGFIX:  When editing a previous QSO, with another QTH/Name than saved in the
           database, the QTH/Name was overwritten in the edit-window. Fixed.

- IMPROVEMENT:  Changed several REGEXP SQL statements to LIKE, which
                increases the speed. 
- IMPROVEMENT:  ADIF import speed increased by the factor of 3..10.
- IMPROVEMENT:  Bands for awards can be specified in the config file .yfklog
                using "awardbands=....". (see sample config file)
- IMPROVEMENT:  Several cosmetic changes to the award and statistic fuctions.

2005-Dec-28:   Version 0.2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- BUGFIX:  ADIF export: the band fieldlength was one too short. eg. <band:2>20m 
- BUGFIX:  ADIF import: Fieldlength 0 didn't work. 
- BUGFIX:  ADIF import: <eoh>/<eor> was errornously case sensitive. 
- BUGFIX:  ADIF import: integer MHz frequencies didn't work, always required
                        decimal separator (e.g. "14.000").
- BUGFIX:  CALL/A became Prefix A0 and no DXCC.
- BUGFIX:  Different calls with the same QSL-Manager were printed on one card!
           e.g.: 8Q7ZZ via G3SWH and 5R8GZ via G3SWH ended up on one card with
           8Q7ZZ in the "To:" field. Fixed this temporarily, for the cost of
           not sorting after the manager's call. Might be changed in future
           versions... (tnx info DL3DTH) 
- BUGFIX:  Name/QTH database update for ADIF import added whole calls
           (including /P etc) to the database instead of the basic call
           (DJ1YFK, AD5UR..) only. Also it tried to add nonexisting fields
           (name/qth) when only one of them was known.
- BUGFIX:  cty.dat includes WAE countries (IG9, IT9, 4U1V, GM/s, IG9, IT9,
           JW/b, TA1) which are *not* DXCCs. Those are now hardcoded into
           yfklog (dxcc sub) to be changed to the proper DXCC. Since they are
           not likely to change in the future, I decided to take this easy
           approach.
           Those DXCCs started with a "*" (*TA1 etc) and are easily filtered
           out.
           A similar problem occurs with DXCCs that have more than 4 letters,
           for example VP8/h. The field for DXCC is only 4 chars long, and
           somehow I forgot to remove the "/". This is now also fixed.
           Unfortunately in an exisiting database from yfklog-0.1.0, the WAEs
           are already counted as new DXCCs, and some DXCCs might be lost
           because of the "/". There is a script "yfk-fixdxcc.pl"
           distributed with yfklog-0.2.0 which fixes these problems. 
- BUGFIX:  Direction of the other station was wrong ("mirrored"). 

- NEW FEATURE:  Statistics: DXCC, PFX, CQZ, IOTA, STATE, QSOs/Band
                (more statistics can easily be added. Don't hesitate to ask me
                for any additions!). See manual for details.
- NEW FEATURE:  In the input form, CURSOR UP goes to the previous field. No
                more need to cycle through all fields to get to the previous
                one. 
- NEW FEATURE:  After entering a call in "Logging Mode", "New Bandpoint" or
                "New DXCC" is displayed if appropriate.
- NEW FEATURE:  In the "QSL-Receive" mode, pressing "s" toggles the "QSL-Sent"
                flag of the QSO, which is useful when you are only replying
                to incoming QSLs.  
- NEW FEATURE:  Simple editor for Name/QTH-Database.
