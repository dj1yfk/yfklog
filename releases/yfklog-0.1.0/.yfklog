# Config file for YFKlog. 
#
# There are two different kinds of settings, MANDATORY settings without which
# the program will NOT WORK and OPTIONAL settings which you might want to
# change, but they have internal defaults if they are not specified.
# Mandatory settings are marked with a "(M)", optional settings with a "(O)" 
# in the first description line.
##############################################################################

# (M) mycall: YFKlog can handle several logs parallell, but this one
# is the one YFKlog starts with. As the name suggests, you should use your
# callsign for it

mycall=dj1yfk

# (M) dbuser: Database username of your MySQL DB access

dbuser=fabian

# (M) dbname: name of the Database. 

dbname=YFKlog

# (M) dbpass: Database password. U should make this file only readable to
# yourself (chmod 600 .yfklog) unless you want everyone to be able to read 
# your password.

dbpass=

# (M) dbserver: Database server

dbserver=127.0.0.1

# (M) dbport: database server port

dbport=3306

# (O) dband: The default band. At the moment YFKlog stores the band in m,
# since I only work from 2190m (136 kHz) - 2m (144 MHz). If there is popular
# demand for it, I could change it to kHz or MHz, so also VHF-EHF can properly
# log their QSOs. Default is my "home band" 80 (m).

dband=80

# (O) dmode: The default mode. You can enter any string here up to 4 letters.
# If you really are so desperate to operate PSK31, use PSK3 or change the
# pogram :-). Of course the default mode is CW :-)

dmode=CW

# (O) dmode: The default power. Only 4 digits for power, some OMs might want to
# regard the number as kW instead of W, some as mW :-)

dpwr=100

# (O) dqsls: Default value for QSL Sent. If not specifield it's "Q" for
# "Queue", meaning that the QSO will be put into the QSL writing-Queue.

dqsls=Q

# (O) sqslr: Default value for QSL received. Usually the QSL has not arrived
# when the QSO happens, so it is N by default

dqslr=N

# (O) dqslsi: Default value for QSL Sent for IMPORTED QSOs, if there is no such
# info in the ADIF. This might be useful because for contest QSOs there is
# usually no such info in the adif, and for those who do not send QSLs for
# every contest QSO this is an easy way to make sure that they don't end up in
# the QSL queue when dqsls=Q.   Default: N

dqslsi=N

# (O) lat and lon: Latitude and longitude of the own station in decimal format.
# Needed to calculate the distance and beam heading.

lat=52
lon=-8

# (O) onlinedata: Specifies the columns of the logbook which will be added to
# the online logbook. Possible columns: NR, CALL, DATE, T_ON, T_OFF, BAND, MODE
# QTH, NAME, QSLS, QSLR, RSTS, RSTR, REM, PWR, DXCC, PFX, CONT, QSLINFO.
# Separate fields with commas

onlinedata=CALL, DATE, BAND, MODE, QSLS, QSLR, PWR, QSLINFO

# (O) ftp-information: If you want to use the upload function for a online
# searchable log, some ftp-settings have to be specified. The names are
# self-explaining.

ftpserver=127.0.0.1
ftpport=21
ftpuser=dj1yfk
ftppass=test
ftpdir=/logs 

# (O) Liddish callsign addidions which have to be removed, so the DXCC and 
# Prefix can be properly determined. If you log stations with their proper 
# calls (/QRP is not a part of the call!), don't bother anyway.

lidadditions=^QRP$|^LGT$

# (O) Additions to the callsign which do not change the DXCC or Prefix; default:
# /P, /M, /MM, /AM. Add your own following the same schema if needed.

csadditions=(^P$)|(^M{1,2}$)|(^AM$)
