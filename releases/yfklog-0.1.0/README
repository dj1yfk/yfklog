3. System requirements
----------------------
YFKlog was developed on Mandrake Linux 9.2 and FreeBSD 5.3 
with Perl v5.8.5.

It requires the Perl modules:
(- strict)
- DBI            - Database
- Curses        - console screen handling
- Net::FTP        - upload of searchable onlinelog
- POSIX            - acos() function for distance and direction

A connection to a MySQL Database, not neccessarily on the same
machine as YFKlog is needed.

For generating QSL-labels, pdflatex with the 'geometry' package is 
needed. 

YFKlog was designed to run in a console with 80x24 characters.
