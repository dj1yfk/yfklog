YFKlog 0.3.1  INSTALLATION GUIDE
--------------------------------

You can chose between using SQLite and MySQL as the database backend for
YFKlog. SQLite is very flexible and easy to set up, and probably the better
choice in most cases. Use MySQL only if you really know why.

SQLite
------
Set 'dbserver=sqlite' in the config file, '.yfklog', and change other settings
(mycall etc.) as desired. That's it!  


MySQL
-----
Please follow these steps carefully.

1 Create a Database (this example uses 'YFKlog' as dbname) and 
  give the user the needed permissions for it (replace "username" with your
  login-name and chose a password for 'passwd').

  $ mysqladmin -u root -p create YFKlog
  $ mysql -u root -p
 
  mysql> GRANT ALL ON YFKlog.* TO username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'passwd';
  mysql> quit

2 Edit the configuration file .yfklog! This is very important, all database
  connections etc. are set up here.
 
3 That's it, start YFKlog:

  $ ./yfk.pl
