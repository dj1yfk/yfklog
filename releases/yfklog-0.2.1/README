3. System requirements
----------------------
YFKlog was developed on Mandrake Linux 9.2, Debian Sarge
and FreeBSD 5.3 with Perl v5.8.5.

It requires the Perl modules:
(- strict)
- DBI             - Database
- Curses          - console screen handling
- Net::FTP        - upload of searchable onlinelog
- POSIX           - acos() function for distance and direction

A connection to a MySQL Database, not neccessarily on the same
machine as YFKlog is needed.

For generating QSL-labels, pdflatex with the 'geometry' package is 
needed. 

YFKlog was designed to run in a console with 80x24 characters.

7. Future plans
---------------

I am always grateful to receive any kind of feedback, bug reports etc. Version
0.2.1 didn't add many new features, but a lot of bugs were fixed and the
documention was improved a bit. 

For version 0.3.0 I am planning to add support of 'hamlib' for rigcontrol
(mainly to get freq/mode from the RIG) and in the future I will also support
XDIF (http://xdif.org/).
Also I am planning to improve the speed by reducing the number of database
queries and caching instead..

Again: If you have any suggestions, feature requests etc, don't hesitate a
moment and send me a mail or contact me via ICQ.
