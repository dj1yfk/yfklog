YFKlog 0.2.1 Manual  
-------------------

This is a short description how to use YFKlog. It's certainly not complete, if
in doubt, have a look at the sources, which contain lots of comments.

Please also read the comments in the configuration file .yfklog carefully,
which explain a lot of details.

Feel free to contact me if you have *any* questions not covered by this document!

F-Keys
------------
At any point, F12 exits and F1 goes back to the main menu. In the different
modes, the F-Keys F2..10 usually have some function, which is indicated in the
lowest line of the screen.
ALT+x or CTL+x combinations are not used.

Main Menu
------------
YFKlog starts in the Main Menu. In this menu you can access all the features of
YFKlog:

1. Logging mode
---------------
In this mode you can enter QSOs. The screen is split into 4 main windows:
Input window, Information Window, Log-Window and Previous-QSO-Window.
You can change between them with F-keys.

1.1 Input window (F8)
---------------------
On the top there is the input window, where you enter the QSO information.
There are 14 fields to enter data. After entering a callsign, the date, time,
power, band, mode settings are automatically filled with the defaults. If
available also Name and QTH is filled from the database. You can now enter all
information of a QSO.
To save screen space, some very rarely used fields of the logbook database
table cannot directly be entered here, namely: QSL-Manger, ITU and CQ-Zone,
IOTA number and the US State. These can be entered into the Remarks field in
the following manner:

Remarks:  via:DJ1YFK CQZ:14 ITUZ:28 IOTA:EU-123 STATE:AZ

There can be anything between it, like

Remarks: QRP 5W via:DJ1YFK longwire antenna IOTA:EU-123

it is only important that there is a space ' ' before and after every of the
special items. After saving the QSO, these values are automatically filled into
the proper database-fields.

F2 saves the current QSO. This only works if there is sufficient data (call,
date, time on, band, mode) and this data is also checked for validity. If the
QSO is valid, it is saved, the log-window updates and all fields are cleared.
If the QSO data is not valid, nothing happens.

F3 wipes out the current QSO.

F9/10 changes to the windows as described below.

TAB/RETURN goes to the next entry field

Cursor-UP goes to the previous field.

1.2 Information Window
----------------------
After entering a callsign, this window displays the informations from the
country-file (DXCC name, Zones, ...) and the calculated distance and bearing.
Also club memberships of the worked station are displayed for award purposes.
These club-memberships are saved in the CLUBS table in the database.
When a new DXCC or DXCC bandpoint have been worked, there is a note in this
window too.

1.3 Log Window (F9)
------------------- 
This window displays the last 8/16 QSOs (depending on screenlayout, see below);
You can change into this window with F9 and select a previous QSO in order to edit it.

1.4 Previous-QSO-Window (F10)
-----------------------------
This window shows all the previous QSOs with the station you are currently
working. The callsign is stripped down to the homecall, so if you are working
TF/DJ1YFK/p, it displays all QSOs with DJ1YFK, including PA/DJ1YFK/p etc.
You can change into this window with F10 and select any QSO and edit it in the
main window.


2. Search and Edit Mode
-----------------------

In this mode you see an input form similar to the logging mode, but this time
with all possible database fields. You can now enter any information here, and
the database will be queried for QSOs matching this. For example if you enter
DJ1YFK as callsign and SSB as mode, and press F5 to search, no QSO will show
up, because DJ1YFK does not work SSB :-)
OK, better example: If you enter DJ1YFK and CW, you will get a list of QSOs
below the entry-form, all with *DJ1YFK* and in CW. Now you can select any of
these QSOs with the cursor keys and press ENTER if you want to edit the QSO.
If you do this, all the fields in the form are filled and you can edit the QSO.
if you are done, press F2 to save, or F3 to cancel. F1 goes back to the main
menu as usual.

3. QSL write mode
-----------------

In this mode you get a list of all QSLs where the QSL-Sent status is "Q", which
means that the QSO is in the QSL-queue. The list contains all information you
need for writing the QSL: QSO#, Call, Name, Manger, Date, Time, Power, band,
Mode and QSL-status.
You can toggle the QSL-status of a QSO by pressing SPACE and proceed with the
next QSL.
F2 saves the changes, F3 cancels all changes.


4. QSL Print mode
-----------------

Produces a PDF file with labels for all queued QSLs. You can select the label
definition and the start label on the sheet (makes it possible to start on the
x th label on a page, if in the previous printing there were some labels left
on a sheet).
TODO Write a little documentation on the label-files. They are basically LaTeX
code for the picture-environment, plus some meta information.


5. QSL receive mode
-------------------
Similar to the QSL write mode. You enter 3 or more letters of a callsign, and
get a list with all QSOs matching this callsign. Then you can quickly toggle
the QSL-received status of these QSOs by hitting SPACE and the QSL-send status
(in case you are replying to incoming QSLs only) with "s".
F2 saves, F3 cancels all changes.


6. ADIF Import
--------------
Imports an ADIF File from the current directory. A list of all .adi files in
the current directory appears. The user can select one to be imported.
If errors are occuring during the import, or unknown data-fields in the
ADIF-file are not imported, warnings/errors are generated. These are written to
a error report, so the user can find out what went wrong.
Note that the file requires to have proper unix linebreaks to be imported. This
can be done with tools like dos2unix if neccessary.

In the configuration file .yfklog you can specify which QSL-Sent-status is
default for imported QSOs, if no information is given in the ADIF file. This
can be useful if you want to put all QSOs from a contest into the QSL-Queue.
   

7. ADIF export
--------------
Exports the current log into a ADIF file.

8. Update Onlinelog
-------------------
Exports the whole log (TBD: specify a range) into a ~-spearated file. The
fields which have to be exported can be specified in the config file,
".yfklog". 
At the user's option, the file is uploaded via FTP to a server which is also
specified in the config file.

9. Logbook Config
-----------------
Shows a selectable list of logbooks in the database. The user can select any of
these logs or create a new logbook, when chosing the option "create new
logbook". The database name is the same as the callsign used; YFKlog by default
tries to access the database named like "MYCALL" in your .yfklog config file.

10. Awards/Statistics
---------------------
Displays the results for several awards (DXCC, WPX (PFX), WAZ (CQZ), IOTA, WAS
(STATE)) or a QSO/Bands overview. A date range can be specified optionally.
Additionally to the normal summary, which looks like this

                              Band    Wkd   Cfmd
                              10      146   65 
                              12      111   44
                              15      168   52
                              17      114   54
                              20      176   82
                              30      127   57
                              40      156   63
                              80      101   41
                              160     66    12
                              All     225   141

an additional detailled list is written into a HTML-formatted file. The
filename will be displayed on the screen.

11. Edit Name/QTH DB
--------------------

YFKlog maintains a database of names/QTHs for callsigns. If you enter a QSO
with a known call, the name- and QTH-fields are automatically filled.
Under this menu-point you can edit the database.
