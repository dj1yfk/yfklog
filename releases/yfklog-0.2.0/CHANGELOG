2005-May-18:   Initial release

2005-Dec-28:   Version 0.2.0

- BUGFIX:  ADIF export: the band fieldlength was one too short. eg. <band:2>20m 
- BUGFIX:  ADIF import: Fieldlength 0 didn't work. 
- BUGFIX:  ADIF import: <eoh>/<eor> was errornously case sensitive. 
- BUGFIX:  ADIF import: integer MHz frequencies didn't work, always required
                        deciman separator (e.g. "14.000").
- BUGFIX:  CALL/A became Prefix A0 and no DXCC.
- BUGFIX:  Different calls with the same QSL-Manager were printed on one card!
           e.g.: 8Q7ZZ via G3SWH and 5R8GZ via G3SWH ended up on one card with
           8Q7ZZ in the "To:" field. Fixed this temporarily, for the cost of
           not sorting after the manager's call. Might be changed in future
           versions... (tnx info DL3DTH) 
- BUGFIX:  Name/QTH database update for ADIF import added whole calls
           (including /P etc) to the database instead of the basic call
           (DJ1YFK, AD5UR..) only. Also it tried to add nonexisting fields
           (name/qth) when only one of them was known.
- BUGFIX:  cty.dat includes WAE countries (IG9, IT9, 4U1V, GM/s, IG9, IT9,
           JW/b, TA1) which are *not* DXCCs. Those are now hardcoded into
           yfklog (dxcc sub) to be changed to the proper DXCC. Since they are
           not likely to change in the future, I decided to take this easy
           approach.
           Those DXCCs started with a "*" (*TA1 etc) and are easily filtered
           out.
           A similar problem occurs with DXCCs that have more than 4 letters,
           for example VP8/h. The field for DXCC is only 4 chars long, and
           somehow I forgot to remove the "/". This is now also fixed.
           Unfortunately in an exisiting database from yfklog-0.1.0, the WAEs
           are already counted as new DXCCs, and some DXCCs might be lost
           because of the "/". There is a script "yfk-fixdxcc.pl"
           distributed with yfklog-0.2.0 which fixes these problems. 
- BUGFIX:  Direction of the other station was wrong ("mirrored"). 

- NEW FEATURE:  Statistics: DXCC, PFX, CQZ, IOTA, STATE, QSOs/Band
                (more statistics can easily be added. Don't hesitate to ask me
                for any additions!). See manual for details.
- NEW FEATURE:  In the input form, CURSOR UP goes to the previous field. No
                more need to cycle through all fields to get to the previous
                one. 
- NEW FEATURE:  After entering a call in "Logging Mode", "New Bandpoint" or
                "New DXCC" is displayed if appropriate.
- NEW FEATURE:  In the "QSL-Receive" mode, pressing "s" toggles the "QSL-Sent"
                flag of the QSO, which is useful when you are only replying
                to incoming QSLs.  
- NEW FEATURE:  Simple editor for Name/QTH-Database.
