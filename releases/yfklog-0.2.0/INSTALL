YFKlog 0.1.0  INSTALLATION GUIDE
--------------------------------

1 Unpack the tar-file into a directory of your choice.

2 Download K1EA's cty.dat file from http://www.k1ea.com/cty/cty.dat
  and put it into the YFKlog directory. Most easily done with wget, fetch
  or curl.

3 Create a Database (this example uses 'YFKlog' as dbname) and 
  give the user the needed permissions for it (replace "username" with your
  login-name.

  $ mysqladmin -u root -p create YFKlog
  $ mysql -u root -p
 
  mysql> GRANT ALL ON YFKlog.* TO username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'passwd';
  mysql> quit

4 Create the tables for club memberships and operator names/qths:
  Make sure to change the database name in dbs.sql to your name, if it's not
  yfklog.

  $ mysql -p < dbs.sql

  Now at your option import any of the .sql files in the 'clubs' subdirectory
  in the same way. 

5 Edit the configuration file .yfklog 
 
6 Start YFKlog:

  & ./yfk.pl

7 Create a new logbook under menu "Logbook config". 
  The name of the logbook should be your callsign, or whatever you set as
  "MYCALL" in the .yfklog config file. Of course you can create several
  logbooks, but the standard logbook is the one specifield as "MYCALL" in the
  configuration file.

8 That's it. You can start logging now.
