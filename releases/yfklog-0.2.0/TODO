- Optimize the speed of DXCC and WPX lookup. During normal logging it is not a
  problem, but when importing ADIF, it gets horribly slow. DXCC also calls WPX,
  so these two should be combined to one function, or at least DXCC should
  return the prefix too.

- Database not well designed for multiple logs. Maybe store everything in one
  table and add a "mycall" field.

- In Search&Edit mode: Specifying a date-range, OR possibility to enter any
  abritary SQL statement to select from the database. 

- The subs &readw; (reads windows/fields in QSO Input mode) and &editw; are
  mostly identical, except for handling of the F-Keys: Thee could be put into a
  single sub which calls an external sub for F-key handling (for better
  readibility).
