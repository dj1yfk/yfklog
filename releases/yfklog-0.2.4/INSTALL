YFKlog 0.2.4  INSTALLATION GUIDE
--------------------------------

Please follow these steps carefully.

1 Create a Database (this example uses 'YFKlog' as dbname) and 
  give the user the needed permissions for it (replace "username" with your
  login-name and chose a password for 'passwd').

  $ mysqladmin -u root -p create YFKlog
  $ mysql -u root -p
 
  mysql> GRANT ALL ON YFKlog.* TO username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'passwd';
  mysql> quit

2 Edit the configuration file .yfklog! This is very important, all database
  connections etc. are set up here.
 
3 That's it, start YFKlog:

  $ ./yfk.pl
