# Config file for YFKlog. 
#
# There are two different kinds of settings, MANDATORY settings without which
# the program will NOT WORK and OPTIONAL settings which you might want to
# change, but they have internal defaults if they are not specified.
# Mandatory settings are marked with a "(M)", optional settings with a "(O)" 
# in the first description line.
##############################################################################

# (M) mycall: YFKlog can handle several logs parallell, but this one
# is the one YFKlog starts with. As the name suggests, you should use your
# callsign for it. Use lowercase letters.

mycall=dl1test

# (M) dbuser: Database username of your MySQL DB access 

dbuser=fabian

# (M) dbname: name of the MySQL Database OR SQLite3 database file.

dbname=YFKlog

# (M) dbpass: ONLY for MySQL.
# Database password. U should make this file only readable to
# yourself (chmod 600 .yfklog) unless you want everyone to be able to read 
# your password.

dbpass=notmypassword

# (M) dbserver: 
#
# If you use SQLite, set  it to 'sqlite'
#
# For MySQL:
# Depending on the configuration of your server,
# only 'localhost' (via a socket) or only '127.0.0.1' (tcp) might work.

dbserver=sqlite

# (M) dbport: database server port (ONLY for MySQL)

dbport=3306

# (O) directory: This is the default directory used for example for ADIF
# import/export, PDF-label output etc. By default it's /tmp.

directory=/tmp

# (O) fieldorder: The order of the fields in the main entry mask.
# Available fields (also default order is:)
# CALL DATE TON TOFF BAND MODE QTH NAME QSLS QSLR RSTS RSTR REM PWR
# You may omit fields you don't need.
# Separate fields with whitespaces.

fieldorder=CALL DATE TON TOFF BAND MODE QTH NAME QSLS QSLR RSTS RSTR REM PWR

# (O) dband: The default band. At the moment YFKlog stores the band in m,
# since I only work from 2190m (136 kHz) - 2m (144 MHz). If there is popular
# demand for it, I could change it to kHz or MHz, so also VHF-EHF can properly
# log their QSOs. Default is my "home band" 80 (m).

dband=80

# (O) dmode: The default mode. You can enter any string here up to 6 letters.

dmode=CW

# (O) dmode: The default power. Only 4 digits for power, some OMs might want to
# regard the number as kW instead of W, some as mW :-)

dpwr=100

# (O) dqsls: Default value for QSL Sent. If not specifield it's "Q" for
# "Queue", meaning that the QSO will be put into the QSL writing-Queue.

dqsls=Q

# (O) dqslr: Default value for QSL received. Usually the QSL has not arrived
# when the QSO happens, so it is N by default

dqslr=N

# (O) dqslsi: Default value for QSL Sent for IMPORTED QSOs, if there is no such
# info in the ADIF. This might be useful because for contest QSOs there is
# usually no such info in the adif, and for those who do not send QSLs for
# every contest QSO this is an easy way to make sure that they don't end up in
# the QSL queue when dqsls=Q.   Default: N

dqslsi=N

# (O) lat and lon: Latitude and longitude of the own station in decimal format.
# Needed to calculate the distance and beam heading.

lat=52
lon=-8

# (O) onlinedata: Specifies the columns of the logbook which will be added to
# the online logbook. Possible columns: NR, CALL, DATE, T_ON, T_OFF, BAND, MODE
# QTH, NAME, QSLS, QSLR, RSTS, RSTR, REM, PWR, DXCC, PFX, CONT, QSLINFO.
# Separate fields with commas

onlinedata=`CALL`, DATE, BAND, MODE, RSTS, RSTR, T_ON, QSLS, QSLR, PWR, QSLINFO, STATE

# (O) ftp-information: If you want to use the upload function for a online
# searchable log, some ftp-settings have to be specified. The names are
# self-explaining.

ftpserver=127.0.0.1
ftpport=21
ftpuser=dj1yfk
ftppass=test
ftpdir=/logs 

# (O) Liddish callsign addidions which have to be removed, so the DXCC and 
# Prefix can be properly determined. If you log stations with their proper 
# calls (/QRP is not a part of the call!), don't bother anyway.

lidadditions=^QRP$|^LGT$|^\d{2,99}$

# (O) Additions to the callsign which do not change the DXCC or Prefix; default:
# /P, /M, /MM, /AM. Add your own following the same schema if needed.

csadditions=(^P$)|(^M{1,2}$)|(^AM$)|(^A$)

# (O) Bands for award/statistic calculations. Default: all bands from 160 to
# 2m. Format: Bands, separated by whitespaces.

awardbands=160 80 40 30 20 17 15 12 10 6 2

# (O) Screenlayout: YFKlog supports (at the moment) two different layouts of
# the main logging screen. You can toggle between them by setting screenlayout
# to either 0 or 1.   

screenlayout=1

# (O) Checklogs: By default, when logging a new callsign, only the previous
# contacts in the current log are checked. It's now possible also to specify
# additional logs that will be checked for QSOs. If a QSO exists, it will be
# shown in the same line where club-membership information is usually shown, in
# a very short form:  e.g:  In logs: 9A/DJ1YFK/p PA/DJ1YFK/p
#
# Format: checklogs=LOG1 LOG2 LOG3...
#
# Example: checklog=DJ1YFK DM7A DG9YFK PA/DJ1YFK/P
#
# NB: The current active log can be included in the list; it'll be ignored.

checklogs=

# (O) hamlib rig model. 0 for no hamlib.

rigmodel=0

# (O) hamlib path to the device. For example /dev/ttyS0 etc.

rigpath=/dev/ttyS0

# (O) autoqueryrig: If set to 1, YFKlog queries the frequency from the
# transceiver via hamlib at every new QSO automatically.

autoqueryrig=0

# (O) operator: As of version 0.2.5, YFKlog can save an operator information
# for every QSO. This is the default value. When logging, QSOs, the OP can also
# be specified in the remarks-field by OPERATOR:DJ1YFK 

operator=

# (O) lotwdetails: If set to 1, include all details (like CQ-Zone, ITU-Zone
# etc) from lotw-reports into the log. If 0, only change the QSLrL flag to Y.

lotwdetails=0

# (O) askme: Ask for confirmation when leaving the logging mode (to the menu)
# without saving the QSO, or deleting a QSO.

askme=1

# (O) logsort: How to sort the QSOs in the log display: Chronological or by the
# QSO-number (how they were entered or imported).
# Possible values: "C" = chronological, "N" = Number (default).

logsort=C

# (O) prevsort: How to sort the display of previous QSOs for a certain call
# D = By date, Descending
# A = By date, ascending. (default)

prevsort=A

# (O) browser: A browser to do QRZ.com call lookups.

browser=firefox

# (O) colors: Use terminal colors (1, default) or not (0).

colors=1

#
# Wether we should use the Ham::Callsign::DB class to look up data to
# fill in QSO information with FCC and/or QRZ lookup information
