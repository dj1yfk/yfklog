3. System requirements
----------------------
YFKlog was developed on Mandrake Linux 9.2, Debian Sarge
and FreeBSD 5.3 with Perl v5.8.5.

It requires the Perl modules:
(- strict)
- DBI             - Database
- Curses          - console screen handling
- Net::FTP        - upload of searchable onlinelog
- POSIX           - acos() function for distance and direction
- Hamlib          - optional for Hamlib.

The database can either be SQLite3 or MySQL. SQLite is probably the better
and easier choice for most users. See 'INSTALL' and the manual for hints to set
up YFKlog.

For generating QSL-labels, pdflatex with the 'geometry' package is 
needed. 

YFKlog was designed to run in a console with 80x24 characters.
