YFKlog 0.4.0  INSTALLATION GUIDE
--------------------------------

More detailled instructions at http://fkurz.net/ham/yfklog/doc/

--------------------------------

YFKlog 0.4.0 comes with a Makefile

$   (sudo) make install [PREFIX=/usr/local]

will install it into PREFIX (default /usr/[bin|share/yfklog/]).

That's all, you can then start 'yfk'. On the first run, you'll be taken to a
configuration menu, where you can set up YFKlog according to your needs.

By default, YFKlog uses a SQLite database, and you don't need to set up
anything manually.


For MySQL-Users only
--------------------

If you want to use MySQL instead of SQLite (I recommend not to use MySQL unless
you *really* know why you want to!) follow these steps:

1 Create a Database (this example uses 'YFKlog' as dbname) and 
  give the user the needed permissions for it (replace "username" with your
  login-name and chose a password for 'passwd').

  $ mysqladmin -u root -p create YFKlog
  $ mysql -u root -p
 
  mysql> GRANT ALL ON YFKlog.* TO username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'passwd';
  mysql> quit

2 Start YFKlog. 

  $ yfk

  On the first run, you'll be taken to a configuration menu, where you have
  to set the database server, port, db-name, username and password.
  Enter these values and you're ready to go.
