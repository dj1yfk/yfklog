RELEASENOTES for YFKlog 0.4.0
==============================

To update from an older version, just replace all files of the old
YFKlog-version with the new ones and follow these instructions: 

Update from YFKlog 0.1.0
------------------------

If you are updating from YFKlog 0.1.0, following additional changes are needed:

1. Copy yfk-fixdxcc.pl into your yfklog-directory and run it. It fixes some
   minor problems of DXCC-handling in 0.1.0.

2. The config-file .yfklog had some changes in the "csadditions" and
   "lidadditions"-lines. You might want to copy these lines to your old config
    file. 
 
3. Follow steps for update from 0.2.0 
 
Update from YFKlog 0.2.0  (!!! Instructions obsolete, see below !!!)
------------------------

1. Some new lines were added to the config file .yfklog, in particular
   "awardbands" and "screenlayout". Also changes in "lidadditions" and
   "csadditions". Copy these lines into your old config-file.

2. The database logging-table structure has changed: In order to allow logging
on VHF-UHF, the "band" field was changed from INT to FLOAT. If you create new
logbooks, you don't need to bother with it; existing logbooks can be converted
by the following procedure: (replace YFKlog with your database name, if
different. Repeat the ALTER TABLE statement for every logbook you want to
change, note that the name of the logbook table [for example log_dj1yfk] is
case sensitive, and internally all callsigns are lowercase. So if your call is
DL1ABC, the line has to be "ALTER TABLE log_dl1abc MODIFY BAND FLOAT;".)

`----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Although nothing critical *should* happen, please make a backup of your
logbooks (ADIF export) before you do this modification.

Update from YFKlog 0.2.1
------------------------
Everything should work after simply replacing the old files. If you are
running into trouble, let me know!

Update from YFKlog 0.2.2 or higher
-----------------------------------
YFKlog as of 0.2.4 automatically tries to update the database structure etc
from any previous version. Any problems with the update should be reported to
the author.

As of 0.3.2, YFKlog doesn't have all its files in one single directory anymore,
rather is searches for the needed files in ~/.yfklog/ and $DESTDIR (by default
/usr[/bin|/share/yfklog/]...). The old .yfklog config file is now
~/.yfklog/config. You can copy your old .yfklog file to ~/.yfklog/config, but
note that several options have been added in the meantime. I'd recommend to
start with a fresh config file. It'll automatically be created on the first
run.
The SQLite database file will also be searched for in ~/.yfklog/, so move/copy
it there if you used SQLite.


If you are encountering any problems, don't hesitate to ask me via e-Mail
